# RecipieSite

#About 
This website is a search engine for Indian food recipes. Users can type in a query, such as "chicken tikka masala" or "palak paneer," and the website will display up to 9 recipe results that match the query. The search results include the recipe name, an image, the list of ingredients, and a link to view the full recipe on the source website.

Api Used 

The website uses the Edamam API to retrieve recipe data. The API requires an app ID and app key, which are obtained by signing up for a free account on the Edamam website. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it runs entirely on the client-side, meaning no server-side code is required.

#Design 

The design of the website is simple and clean, with a focus on ease of use and quick access to recipe information. Users can quickly search for recipes without having to navigate through a lot of clutter or unnecessary content. The website is also mobile-friendly, so users can easily access it on their phones or tablets while cooking in the kitchen.
